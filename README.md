# functionaljs
A repo with functional examples and library code.
In the ex folder we find the examples files.
In the lib folder we find the lib files.
Basic JavaScript implementations of various functions described in the book. 
Keep in mind that these implementations may not be the fastest or the most efficient implementation out there; they solely serve an EDUCATIONAL purpose.

In order to find functions that are more production-ready, have a peek at ramda, lodash, or folktale.
